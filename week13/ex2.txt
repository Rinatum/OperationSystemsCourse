1. Recovery from Deadlock:
000000000000
 through Preemption: may be hard because this type of recovering highly depends on the nature of resource, choosing the process to suspend depends on which ones have resources to easily take back.
000000000000
 through Rollback: checkpointing is time and space consuming
000000000000
 through Killing Processes: cannot kill any process because restarting one, it may redo some operations already done and effect the system, data in wrong way.
2. Avoidance is better than recovery but still almost not realistic because of some necessary assumptions:
---------> when a process asks for resources, it asks for them all at once;
---------> certain information should be available.
3. Prevention is much better than previous attempts because it tries to break some condition of deadlocking.
==========================
This approach is possible and holds the goal of deadlocks.
