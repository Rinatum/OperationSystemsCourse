1)
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 5 6 6 5 1 1 1 | Ratio = 1.666667
   1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 1 1 6 5 1 1 1 | Ratio : 2.200000
   1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 | Ratio : 3.000000
   1 1 1 4 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | Ratio : 4.333333

   For size of page table = 3

2)
   For increasing of ratio we need to increase amount of repeated numbers and decrease a distance between of them.
    Also try to achieve [size of page table >= amount of unique numbers in sequence]
